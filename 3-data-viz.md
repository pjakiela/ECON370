## Lab  

Objective:  for this lab, you will be using the [replication files](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10361258&version=1.0) from my paper [A Firm of Oneâ€™s Own: Experimental Evidence On Credit Constraints and Occupational Choice](https://pjakiela.github.io/research/BHIJO-REStat-2024-05-24.pdf).  The paper describes the results of a randomized trial evaluating the impact of a program intended to help young women in Nairobi become small-scale entrepreneurs.  You can read a short article summarizing our study [here](https://voxdev.org/topic/firms/comparing-approaches-breaking-poverty-trap-promoting-entrepreneurship).  In this lab, you'll be making a figure summarizing the treatment effects of the two intervention arms in the study on rates of self-employment.  Details are contained in the R/Python code template [ECON370-lab3.txt](ECON370-lab3.txt).  

As part of the lab, you will be asked to replicate the following graph:
