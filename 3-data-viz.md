## Lab  

Objective:  conduct exploratory data analysis of transaction-level data from Provisions Williamstown.  After loading and cleaning the 
transactions data, you will create a summary statistics table, a histogram of transaction amounts, a histogram of daily/weekly/monthly sales or revenues, 
and a scatter plot.  Details are contained in the R/Python code template [ECON370-lab2.txt](ECON370-lab2.txt).  

You will upload a finished summary statistics table that is either a pdf produced using latex or an html file.  A latex template is available [here](ECON370-table-template.tex), and an html template is available [here](ECON370-html-table-template.txt).  You can compile the latex template using overleaf or your favorite latex editor.  

As part of the lab, you will be asked to replicate the following graph:
