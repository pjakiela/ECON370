# Data Science for Economics  

_This is the website for Professor Pamela Jakiela's ECON 370 course at Williams College, Data Science for Economic Analysis._  

<br>

## Course Description:  

This course provides a hands-on introduction to data science tools most relevant for economic analysis including data visualization, machine learning, and text analysis. Economists and other social scientists tend to use these data science tools differently than many researchers in statistics and computer science â€“ conducting empirical analysis that is explicitly grounded in economic theory, and focusing on causal inference rather than prediction. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on labs, and group projects, students will develop the theoretical and practical skills needed to analyze economic data using modern data science techniques in R or Python.
