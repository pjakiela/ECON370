## Lab

Objective: in this lab, you will implement $k$-fold cross-validation (with k = 10) using the data on GDP per capita and educational attainment from lab #1 to find the polynomial function of log GDP that best predicts educational attainment. You will do this without using any packages or pre-built functions that implement cross-validation.  

A text file outlining the steps in the lab is available [here](ECON370-lab5.txt). When you are finished with the lab, you can upload it [here]().
